        students of IIT Bombay. <br> <br>
        In the next session, David Green, the New Product Development Technical Leader at Cummins
        India, explained what Product Life Cycle exactly is. He elaborated on how the life of a new
        product starts, grows, and then ends at one point. He explained some of his projects at
        Cummins India, and, stated the implications of the Product Life Cycle and how long-term
        product planning and technology research needs to be aligned in a way that technology exists
        to support timely new product development and to ensure that market-leading new products
        are launched.

          The second day of the Incube conference began with Ritvi Mishra's talk about
          the different IoT protocols and platforms available for medical technology and its significance.
          She shared her research done during the coronavirus pandemic and explained the increased
          demand for health services which led her to think about the use of IoT in medical technology.
          Throughout the session, she explained various protocols like BLE, ZIGBEE, etc. which
          implement IoT and have applications in the health services sector. <br><br>
          In the next session, Neha Tiwari explained about the “new normal”, about the pandemic and
          its impacts, various restrictions imposed on us, the increasing fear and uncertainty, our

          audience about the 3 C’s of navigating the pandemic – 1. Compassion 2. Competence and 3.
          Change Management. She used the metaphor of the infamous story of the eagle shredding
          its skin midway through its life for rebirth. She reminded us, hence, to adapt, accept, and
          change as required. To keep hoping and moving. And finally, to keep navigating the pandemic
          change as required. <br><br>
          In the third session of the day, Yashashree Nigudkar spoke about the various technical aspects
          of the use of Machine Learning (ML) in stock price prediction. Starting with the basic
          introduction to AI and ML, she went on to explain the fields where AI is applicable- ranging
          from automation, gaming, smart devices to detecting diseases, analyzing background history
          of people, and predictions of a variety of things. She highlighted the importance of the right
          stock market investment as an additional source of income. <br> <br>
          In the fourth and final session, Rucha Kulkarni explained how the use of biosignals can change
          the face of rehabilitation engineering. She explained the applications of rehabilitation
          engineering, Electromyography (EMG) is and how does it work by giving examples of EMG
          signal graphs and an explanation of the mathematical aspect of it. Then, Rucha shared with
          the audience, four different papers she had been reviewing and compared the accuracy
          results for each of them. Each of the papers had different algorithms, different numbers of
          features used along with some other factors. All the papers were compared and it was shown
          how different factors can have different accuracy results.

          about the future of shopping malls and markets and throwing light on the wide potential of
          augmented reality to revolutionize industries and enterprises. The main idea behind E mart is
          to create an immersive shopping experience by using augmented reality (AR). The speaker
          talked about AR, its applications, it's working, and also the challenges faced while
          implementing it. <br> <br>

          winning social enterprise with the mission to preserve & promote the heritage folk art of
          India. The speaker stressed the importance of technology in women empowerment. She put
          forth some interesting anecdotes about how her background in technology proved
          advantageous in networking, marketing, brand building, etc. Increased awareness through
          access to global information is one of the key factors that benefit women entrepreneurs. Her
          journey is indeed inspirational for all. <br><br>
          One of the topics for day 3 of the Incube conference was ‘Harnessing technology for social
          good’. Tanya Jojy and Poorva Bhalerao, the speakers, began with a poll. They then threw light
          upon the history of technology, shared few laws like Moore’s law, and talked about recent
          developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They explained sustainable
          software engineering and spoke about the social impact revolution which can be observed by
          the change in investments, policies, choice of careers, how funds are endowed. They
          highlighted points like being aware of the social issues and thinking ways to solve them,
          making technology cheap and accessible to all. Elaborating design thinking, they said that
          good design is the basis of a good product. Sustainability, psychology, a good user interface,
          and a good user experience is very important. <br> <br>
          The last talk of Day 3 of the Incube Conference, was by Nandini Singh, a second-year E&TC
          student, who knows a thing or two about mental disorders, gave a talk on “Sensitisation in
          Changing Times” where she mainly addressed some of the misconceptions regarding mental
          health and provided a socio-economic perspective on the same. Nandini shared more of her
          personal experiences and urged the audience to provide and seek help, whenever and
          wherever the need be. She concluded her talk by quoting Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first
          Director-General of WHO, who had declared that- “Without mental health, there can be no
          true physical health.”
