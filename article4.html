        <h4 style="margin-top: 5%; font-size: 300%;" class="text-center">Women Led Tech Start-Ups</h4><br><br>
        <p>  In a country like India where most of the women aren't encouraged to think big (especially in the rural parts of the nation), there are some who have soared higher than one would expect. These wonder women are inspiring other ladies to venture on the path of entrepreneurship through their success stories comprising personal struggles and challenges. As a result, India is steadily rising up the ranks when it comes to a favourable start up environment coupled with some solid backing from the Indian government. With the consistent developments in the Indian start up ecosystem, more and more women are chasing the entrepreneurial dream and flourishing in their ventures. This is empowering other Indian women who are still confined to the traditional homemaker role to think for themselves. However, a recent report states that only two Indian cities have made it to the list of the 50 most favourable global places for women to work. India’s Silicon Valley,Bengalaru, ranked 40th, while Delhi was at the 49th place. According to a report by Google, women entrepreneurs can generate 150-170 million job opportunities in India by 2030. Here are some of the well known female led start ups in India.</p>


<h4>1.Aditi Gupta: The Co-founder of Menstrupedia</h4>
<p>
  Aditi Gupta is a social-cause entrepreneur and the co-founder of Menstrupedia that works on spreading awareness about menstruation.

In 2014 she was listed on the Forbes India 30 under 30 list for her work towards breaking the taboo. Today, Menstrupedia has been used in more than 6,000 schools and has benefited more than 10,00,000 girls in over 14 languages.

<h4>2.Upasana Taku: Founder Mobikwik</h4>
<p>Upasana Taku co-founded Mobikwik with her husband, Bipin Preet Singh. Mobikwik is a fintech start up.

It is a virtual wallet tied to a huge network of companies and services. People can recharge and pay at registered places through the Mobikwik wallet. Upasana has a strong fintech background, having worked as a senior product manager at PayPal in Silicon Valley and with HSBC (San Diego) prior to that. She graduated with a bachelor's in engineering from NIT Jalandhar and has a master's degree in management science from Stanford University. Airbrushed by this incredible story, though, are Upasana’s personal trials and conquests. “Initially when I was responsible for managing finances at MobiKwik, often auditors or investors and bankers would be surprised and ask to deal with someone male. This was shocking to me given that banking is an industry where female leaders are not uncommon,” she reveals.</p>
