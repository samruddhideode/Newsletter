      <h3 class="text-center">Dr. Anagha Kulkarni</h3>
<p>  <img class="ordinary1"src="images/anaghakulkarni.png" class="out-img" alt="">
<h5>What motivated you to enter the STEM fields? Was there a moment when you knew engineering was the right career path for you?</h5>
<p>I had an inclination towards Mathematics and Physics right from the beginning. I had made up my mind to take up engineering in my 10th Grade itself.
</p><h5>Who was your biggest support system during the initial days of your career?

</h5>
<p>Of course, my father and mother supported all my decisions. They, in fact, encouraged me to pursue engineering as my career. Not only that, in the early 90s, they had no objection to my staying in Bangalore and Mumbai for the job.
</p>
<h5>What challenges have you faced in your career and how did you overcome them? / Have you faced any roadblocks or setbacks which might be influenced by your gender?

</h5>
<p>In my 11th grade, I had opted for ‘Building Construction’ as one of my subjects. I was the only girl among 25 boys. The boys used to have discussions regarding the practicals of the subjects. However, I had no one to discuss with. I had to learn on my own. I specialised in drawing the plans so much that one of my drawings was selected for building the house actually!
</p>
<p>Back in the 80s the scenario was very different. Very few girls pursued engineering. In fact, employers preferred recruiting boys. I remember appearing for an interview during my last year of engineering. The HR person asked me - a few years down the line, you will get married and leave the company, why should we recruit you? The recruiter was right in his place, but the boys he recruited also left in a couple of years as they got better opportunities. Gender bias was more then!
</p>
<p>
After having kids, I had a break in my career. However, my husband supported me and I could start my second inning at Cummins College of Engineering for Women (CCEW). I was worried about my kids, had lost touch with the updates in the field and was unsure about my capabilities. But my husband kept on ensuring that within a few days I would be back to normal and be 100% productive.
</p>
<h5>What is it like to be a woman in engineering? Do you feel that being a woman gives you a different perspective and experience from your male counterparts?

</h5>
<p>Now, the society is used to Woman Engineers. In fact, people have started believing that Engineering is the most suitable profession for girls. Having diversity is very important. Gender diversity, regional diversity, cultural diversity etc play an important role in the development of an organization.
</p>
 <h5>What inspired you to bring SWE to Cummins College? What made you think we should have a Society of Women Engineers here at Cummins?
</h5>
<p>SWE works for empowerment of women. SWE encourages women engineers to reach their potential in education and profession. The mission of CCEW is in line with SWE’s mission. CCEW empowers women through education. It was a very natural thing to have an SWE affiliate in CCEW.
</p>
<h5>How was the student response initially? How many people did you start with? What  events or activities did you hold then to inspire more women to be a part of this organization?
</h5>
<p>
Initially (in 2016), I and the panel members had to organize a lot of talks to increase the awareness of SWE Affiliate among students. Students had heard about chapters of Professional Societies focusing more on technical aspects. Having an affiliate which focussed on all-round development was something new. The Inaugural session of SWE CCEW Affiliate in June 2016 was a grand ceremony. 7-8 guests including office bearers from SWE India, SWE Pune and Cummins India Ltd were invited. The panel consisted of only 4 members to begin with. Some students expressed their unavailability to work because SWE does not focus on technical aspects only.
</p>
<h5>What is your most memorable event conducted by the affiliate?</h5>
<p>There are quite a few! The Inaugural Session of SWE-CCEW Affiliate in 2016, a talk on ‘Career Opportunities for Women in Indian Air Force’ by Rtd Wing Commander Kanchan Singh in 2016, a ‘Career Day’ where Karen Ramsey-Idem, Neema Nair and Rtd Wing Commander Kanchan Singh guided the students in 2017, the exhibition on ‘Women in Engineering’ in 2018, visit to Maher Ashram in 2019 and many more.

</p>
<h5>Do you think our college’s SWE affiliate is different from those of other            organizations? What, according to you, makes it stand out?
</h5>
<p>Yes, it is run by all-women! Girl power!! The panel members are very enthusiastic. They come up with a variety of ideas, nurture their successors and make sure the affiliate is even stronger the next year.

</p>
<h5>Why do you think STEM outreach programs are necessary? How do you see            these programs being affected by the current pandemic problem?

</h5>
<p>Outreach programs are very important to increase the awareness of STEM among school going kids especially under-previleged kids. With continuous nurturing programs and follow-ups, more kids will pursue STEM fields. Because of the changed conditions now, the affiliate hasn’t been able to organize introductory sessions yet, all events are being organized online. However, we have taken advantage of the online sessions by inviting speakers outside Pune to guide our students.

</p>
<h5>Do you think your vision for the Cummins College affiliate of SWE has been realized?
</h5>
<p>Yes. Students are getting opportunities to lead, to work in teams, to plan different activities. As a result, the students who have been associated with SWE CCEW affiliate have been placed in esteemed companies and are going for higher studies. The panel is now being appreciated by SWE for the efforts that are being taken.
